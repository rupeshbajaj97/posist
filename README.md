This program is menu driven  so we can select function from the given menu 
## Run steps:
Generated a class with all the guven information;
Create object of that class resulting in generic tree:
Add child node only if sum of siblings is less than the child of parent node
For encrypting and decrypting it is muted with a extra string character
Now for the node which has the maximum value of (left_height + right_height + 1), we find the longest root to leaf path on the left side and similarly on the right side. Finally, we print left side path, root and right side path.

This program is menu driven  so we can select function from the given menu 
## Run steps:
1)Generated a class with all the guven information  
2)Create object of that class resulting in generic tree 
3)Add child node only if sum of siblings is less than the child of parent node
4)For encrypting and decrypting it is muted with a extra string character
5)Now for the node which has the maximum value of (left_height + right_height + 1), we find the longest root to leaf path on the left side and similarly on the right side. Finally, we print left side path, root and right side path.
